## Next.js + Code Hike

_Based on [Next.js official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx)._

Start by installing next and react on an empty directory:

<CH.Code showCopyButton>

```bash
npm install next react react-dom
```

</CH.Code>

<CH.Section>

Then also install the [mdx plugin for next](focus://1[13:21]), the [mdx loader](focus://1[23:36]), and [Code Hike](focus://1[38:56]).

<CH.Code showCopyButton>

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @code-hike/mdx
```

</CH.Code>

</CH.Section>

Create a `next.config.js` file at the root of your project.

We use the _`@next/mdx`_ plugin to [set up MDX imports](focus://1:6,8,13).

Inside the _`withMDX`_ function we pass the Next JS config. Make sure to [include `"md"` and `"mdx"`](focus://9,11[12:22],12) on the _`pageExtensions`_ setting if you want to write MDX files directly in your `pages` directory.

After this step, you can use MDX files in your project, but you can't use Code Hike yet.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js next.config.js
const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
  },
})

module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: [
    "ts", "tsx", "js", 
    "jsx", "md", "mdx"
  ],
})
```

---

To set up Code Hike you need to import the _`@code-hike/mdx`_ plugin, and add it to the _`remarkPlugins`_ array in the `next.config.js` file.

Next to the plugin you can pass [a config object](focus://10[24:32]). Almost always you'll want to pass a `theme` there. For more information about themes, see the [themes docs](/docs/themes).

You can also pass more options, like `lineNumbers` for example. See the [configuration docs](/docs/configuration) for more information.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js next.config.js focus=1:3,8:10
const {
  remarkCodeHike,
} = require("@code-hike/mdx")

const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [
      [remarkCodeHike, { theme: "nord" }]
    ],
  },
})

module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: [
    "ts", "tsx", "js", 
    "jsx", "md", "mdx"
  ],
})
```

---

Then you need to create a `pages/_app.js` file if you don't have one.

The _`MyApp`_ component is where you put global stuff that applies to all pages.

You can find more information about the `_app.js` file in the [Next.js official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js pages/_app.js
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```

---

We use `pages/_app.js` file to import Code Hike's stylesheet.

If you want to customize Code Hike's styles with a global stylesheet make sure to import it after this import to avoid specificity issues.

You can learn more about customizing Code Hike styles in the [styling docs](/docs/styling).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js pages/_app.js focus=1
import "@code-hike/mdx/dist/index.css"

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```

---

And now you should be able to use Code Hike inside your mdx files.

For example, create an `index.mdx` file in your `pages` directory, and run Next with `npx next`.

If you open _`localhost:3000`_ on your browser you should see Code Hike's syntax highlighting.

Markdown (.md) files should also work.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
~~~md pages/index.mdx
# Hello

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

```python hello.py
print("Rendered with Code Hike")
```

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
~~~
