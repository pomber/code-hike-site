The `theme` option accepts a `string` for built-in themes or an `object` for custom themes.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js config.js
import { remarkCodeHike } from "@code-hike/mdx"

// focus
// config depends on the framework you're using
mdxOptions = {
  remarkPlugins: [
    // focus[22:43]
    // mark[32:40]
    [remarkCodeHike, { theme: "dark-plus" }],
    anotherPlugin,
  ],
}
```

## Built in themes

<BuitInThemes />

## Light/Dark mode

There are also two built-in themes that support light/dark mode using CSS:

<FromCSSThemes />

To use them you need to include the colors as CSS variables. You can copy the CSS from here:

- [`github-from-css` colors](https://github.com/code-hike/lighter/blob/main/lib/themes/github-from-css.css)
- [`material-from-css` colors](https://github.com/code-hike/lighter/blob/main/lib/themes/material-from-css.css)

and adapt it to your needs by changing the CSS selector.

## Custom themes and VS Code themes

You can use the [Theme Editor](https://themes.codehike.org/editor) to customize any of the built-in themes or any theme from the VS Code marketplace.

Once you have your theme, import it in your config file:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js config.js
import { remarkCodeHike } from "@code-hike/mdx"
// focus
import myTheme from "./my-theme"

mdxOptions = {
  remarkPlugins: [
    // focus[22:39]
    [remarkCodeHike, { theme: myTheme }],
    anotherPlugin,
  ],
}
```
